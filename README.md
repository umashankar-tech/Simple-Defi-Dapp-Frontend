## Overview
This project is a starter template for building decentralized applications (dApps) using React. You can use it as a foundation to connect to blockchain networks and interact with smart contracts. In this template, users can fund a smart contract, while the contract owner has the ability to withdraw funds and view a list of addresses that have contributed funding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or above recommended)
- npm (v8 or above)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Simple-Defi-Dapp-Frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App
Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` — Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test` — Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build` — Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject` — Ejects the app for full configuration control (not reversible).
